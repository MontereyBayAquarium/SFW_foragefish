## Description:
This code allows for the identification of key forage species concerning their trophic
linkages within an ecosystemâ€™s food web. This is done by calculating three published indices, including the connectance index and the SUpportive Role to Fishery ecosystems (SURF) index calculated from mass-balanced models, and the SURF index calculated from energy-balanced models. All use food web data from existing static ecosystem food web models.

## In the repository:
The data/raw folder of .xlsx files is needed to replicate these analyses.

The folder contains two types of .xlsx files:
`diet.xlsx` -- diet matrix data file with all species used in the project

`groupdata.xlsx` -- data file containing all species groups used in the project (rows) 
and the following information for each: B, QB, ED, ED source, group name and group code (columns)

Two .R scripts are needed to replicate these analyses. 
`index_calculations.R` -- R code to calculate connectance, SURF mass and SURF energy indices
`group.aggregating.fxn.R` -- R code to create function to aggregate groups in diet matrices to calculate keyness at a coarser taxonomic resolution

Instructions:
1. Run the `group.aggregating.fxn.R` script to define a necessary function
2. Run the `index_calculations.R` to perform all calculations and output data files.

This will perform calculations for every geography represented by .xlsx data files 
in the data/raw folder. If you are interested in performing calculations for only
one geography, the code can be edited by defining your geography of interest as a
numerical value (geog=# instead of code line 35) and running the code without the
outermost for loop.
